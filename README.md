# Simplified Log in function

This activity in JavaScript allows you to enter a username and password.
There is an existing database(array with object) that contains an existing user. I created a function that will check if the user is already in the database or not.

## Need to Improve
-A fuction that will ask the user to register username and password (adding data into the database)
